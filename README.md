# Knot ID

Knot ID is a website for analysing the knot type of curves, which can be uploaded in different ways including via a drawing interface, as sets of points, or via standard topological notations.

The website can be viewed at http://inclem.net/knotidentifier/ .

Knot ID is developed as part of the [Scientific Properties of Complex Knots (SPOCK) Programme Grant](http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/spock/index.html/), a collaboration between Durham University and the University of Bristol, funded by the Leverhulme Trust.

## Technical details

Knot ID is written in Python using the Flask framework. Topological analysis use the pyknot2 library.
