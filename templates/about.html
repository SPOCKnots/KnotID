<h2>Knot ID</h2>

<p>
    Knot ID is developed as part of the <a href="http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/spock/index.html/">Scientific Properties of Complex
    Knots (SPOCK) Programme Grant</a>, a collaboration between Durham
    University and the University of Bristol funded by the Leverhulme
    Trust.

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>
    These tools run largely on Python and Cython. The web interface uses
    Flask. Topological invariants are calculated using mainly our own
    numerical implementations (intended to be referenced
    somewhere). Cypari is used for symbolic calculation of the Alexander
    polynomial, and Snappy for the hyperbolic volume. Three dimensional
    visualisations use three.js, and the drawing interface uses two.js.
