<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>
This site runs on Python and Cython. The web interface is created using Flask. Topological invariants are calculated using our own numerical implementations (intended to be referenced somewhere). Cypari is used for symbolic calculation of the Alexander polynomial, and Snappy for the hyperbolic volume.
